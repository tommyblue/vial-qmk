# ximi (beta, never worked)

* Keyboard Maintainer: sadekbaroudi
* Hardware Supported: ximi PCB

IMPORTANT NOTE TO SELF, ADD THIS BACK INTO fp_build.json WHEN AUDIO SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE FOR RP2040
    {
        "type" : "single",
        "name" : "AUDIO_ENABLE",
        "user_input": "Do you have audio buzzer?"
    },

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):
```
    make fingerpunch/ximi:default RGBLIGHT_ENABLE=yes FP_CIRQUE_BOTH=yes HAPTIC_ENABLE=yes
```

Options are:
```
    RGBLIGHT_ENABLE=yes
    AUDIO_ENABLE=yes
    HAPTIC_FEEDBACK=yes
    // for the options below, select only one, or none
    FP_TRACKBALL_BOTH=yes
    FP_CIRQUE_BOTH=yes
    FP_TRACKBALL_LEFT_ONLY=yes
    FP_TRACKBALL_RIGHT_ONLY=yes
    FP_CIRQUE_LEFT_ONLY=yes
    FP_CIRQUE_RIGHT_ONLY=yes
    FP_TRACKBALL_LEFT_CIRQUE_RIGHT=yes
    FP_CIRQUE_LEFT_TRACKBALL_RIGHT=yes
    FP_SPLIT_LEFT=yes     # only applicable if doing a mixed pointing device build (e.g. trackpad left, trackball right)
    FP_SPLIT_RIGHT=yes     # only applicable if doing a mixed pointing device build (e.g. trackpad left, trackball right)
```

Notes:
* Pick one (or none) of FP_TRACKBALL_* or FP_CIRQUE_* only.
* If you are using a trackball, you cannot use per key rgb or audio. It will be automatically disabled. The hardware doesn't support them together.

## Choosing which board to plug the USB cable into (choosing Master)

Because the two boards are identical, the firmware has logic to differentiate the left and right board. It uses two strategies to figure things out, [EE_HANDS](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_split_keyboard?id=handedness-by-eeprom) or [by define](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_split_keyboard?id=handedness-by-define). See [setting-handedness](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/config_options?id=setting-handedness) for more information.
